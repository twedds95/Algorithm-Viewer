# Algorithm-Viewer
Web app to visualize different algorithms, and other fun projects

Personal project that started off as just a visualization of sorting algorithms, but now takes on any other personal project or challenge I code.

## List of Challenges Completed:
### Sorting Visualizations    
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Bead Sort (Gravity Sort)
    - Insertion Sort
### Path Finding Visualization with A*
### Fourier Transform Visualization 
Draw anything and have it drawn back to your using Fourier Transorms to define every continuous line.
### Smart Rockets (Evolutionary Algorithm)
Rockets that evolve from generation to generation as they try to make it to their landing zone without crashing.
